**Preparation Stage Day 1 Progress**:
**Setting Up Git And GitHub**
- Preparation stage to me was a challenge on it own, possibly gaining knowledge and understanding the basics of Git and GitHub.
  With few days to get involved were some free youtube videos below for Git and GitHub I took path in to earn such knowledge and understanding.

**Link to work:**
- Mosh Hamedani's [Git Tutorial For Beginners: Learn Git In 1 Hour](https://youtu.be/8JJ101D3knE)
- KodeKloud's [Git Basics For DevOps Beginner](https://youtu.be/Lr7sYCrhxE0)
- @en1tan [100DaysOfCode README Template](https://github.com/en1tan/100-days-csharp)

**New thing(s) learned:**
- Git and Git commands.
- GitHub's Repository.
- SSH Key Authentication For GitHub.
 
**Thoughts:**
- First stage has been great so far as i got myself creating my first GitHub Repository and authenticating with SSH Key.
- Using the Git commands has been really helpful as in remotely working to my GitHub Repository as i hope to create, access and modify more files ahead of new projects created.

**Preparation Stage Day 2 Progress**:
**Setting Up My Environment**
- I made few google researches and found Visual Studio Code as an ideal environment to start with preparation day 2.
- Installation went smooth with extra command line works for the installation of .NET onto my linux machine
- No much time wasted after .NET, very eager to start up getting through with basic tutorials on the Microsoft webpage
  and YES!, FINALLY! the output was "Hello, World!".
- With VScode as my editor and following .NET tutorial, i edited the Program.cs file in the myApp dotnet folder,run it and gave same output as in the tutorial.
```c#
using System;

namespace myApp
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
            Console.WriteLine("The current time is " + DateTime.Now);
        }
    }
}
```

**Link to work:**
- [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [.NET Linux Installation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/core/install/linux)
- [Intro. To .NET Tutorials](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/dotnet/hello-world-tutorial/intro)

**New thing(s) learned:**
- Installed VScode.
- Installed Dotnet.
- Created and Run Console App Using below dotnet commands.
```
dotnet new console -o myApp
cd myApp
dotnet run
```
- Got familiar with some dotnet commands.

**Thoughts:**
- The feeling when you finally see the legendary "Hello, World!" on your terminal console and editing it to output other messages  should be a smile
  and yes, that was a big smile on my face as i finally made progress to tell the computer to output what i want.
  That alone has is an inspiration to continue my challenges ahead.
